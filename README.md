# ⭐️ Medium Coming Soon!! ⭐️ 

* I'm setting up a Medium and this will be my first post: *

Third Chainlink Hackathon project has shipped!  Side-by-side comparison with the first one we shipped a year ago?  We’ve definitely sharpened some skills.  It’s exciting!  It'll take a little time to fully absorb all we accomplished, but we're looking toward the future and figuring out our next steps.  For me, that's focusing on the frontend aspect of full stack design.

I learned the foundation of what I know about React and ethers.js at Buildspace, and am incredibly grateful to have been tossed in the deep end in such a supportive way.  (If you’re exploring web3 and decentralized tech and haven’t yet discovered Buildspace, I highly recommend it!)

While working on Buildspace projects, the Solidity parts (and the Rust parts) felt natural and clear.  Coupled with CryptoZombies, those contracts are a delightful Solidity sandbox.    

React was where I stumbled because I’d never seen it before.  A little JavaScript folded into a careful mixture of HTML & CSS was my old-school approach.  Being very late to the React party, even when accompanied by the talented and experienced crew from Buildspace, has been…an interesting challenge.  No walls were actually punched, and only a few tears were actually shed, but React seems…spaghettified, and held together with duct-tape and paperclips.  Working with React has given me a different perspective on ‘updating legacy systems.’

The traditions and nuances lurking under the surface of the current iteration of React give it structure.  React is layers upon layers of legacy system updates.  On one hand, that’s an amazing feat, but on the other hand, it’s a lot of layers for frontend engineers to untangle in order to make React do what they want it to do.  This explains the plethora of libraries to import.  If it won’t do what you want it to do, build a library to solve the problem.  It’s a system that works, especially for devs who are experienced with React and have a solid understanding of it’s foibles and nuances.  For noobs, though, it’s a different story.  My strength with HTML & CSS, and my competence with Solidity & JavaScript made using React possible for me.  

I respect React, but between now and the next Chainlink Hackathon, I’ll be looking at other ways to construct frontends that can read and write blockchain data.  React is used widely for a reason, but Vue3 and Angular are both intriguing.  I’m also heading back to Codecademy to learn TypeScript.

I’m curious about design platforms like Framer, but I’m a builder.  I like to build interconnected full stacks.             
Anyway, I've been working on a contract for an NFT game (not for the hackathon) and plan to build the frontend for that with Vue.

Stay tuned! 🙏🏻
