# Vue-Quest

⭐️ Coming Soon!! ⭐️ 

I am prepaing to embark on an adventure...a Quest. ✨  I'm looking for that frenly land where the Vue is open...

Okay, I'm stretching that a bit. (a lot?) For now, know that the Vue Quest will begin later in November (after we submit our Chainlink Hackathon project).

Why do I want to learn Vue?  I explored it a little during the hackathon and it's just so user-frenly and clean!  I'm not sure how readily available blockchain integrations are so...going to document my search for those right here as part of my journey. 🗺  I freely admit my love of CSS + HTML and Vue just seems like a great place for them to shine.

React is...okay...but...diving in more deeply and really working with it has given me a fresh perspective on the issues involved with 'building on legacy systems'. 🍝 

Anyway, I've been working on a contract for an NFT game (not for the hackathon) and plan to build the frontend for that with Vue.

Stay tuned! 🙏🏻
